Compare the performance of three AI models by making predictions of housing prices.
Process the .csv files and then train the Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Network models on part of the data and use them to predict the prices of the rest of the data.
I conducted this experiment on each set of data and compared the performance of these models.
